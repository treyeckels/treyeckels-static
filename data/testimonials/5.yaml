text: "<h6>Analytical, Deep Diver</h6>Trey holds his own in a tech conversation, is very analytical and dives deep into problems to figure out the most efficient solution. Given a problem, he would analyze not just the most popular solution for it, but possible alternatives too. At the end, when Trey made a recommendation, you knew it was a solid choice. I would highly recommend Trey for a senior developer position."
