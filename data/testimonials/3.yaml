text: "<h6>Eat, Sleep, Code</h6>Trey lives by the adage of eat, sleep code. If he's not eating or sleeping, he's either coding, or on his way to code, or on his way home from coding and upon arrival he'll be coding some more. He is constantly learning and teaching himself, and by constantly I mean constantly. In line at the movies, at dinner, during stop lights, he'll be learning more about coding. He has a deep passion and thirst for knowledge and new challenges."
